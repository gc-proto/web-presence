<h2 id="s1">Introduction to top tasks on Canada.ca</h2>

<p>To complete a task, people need to navigate, read, and interact with web pages and apps.</p>

<p>People come to Canada.ca with a goal in mind and a task that they want to accomplish. If they are able to accomplish their task, their need has been met. If not, we have work to do.</p>

<p>The Top Task Inventory of the Government of Canada (GC) includes the 100 most in-demand tasks across Government of Canada websites – we are working to improve the information and services supporting these top tasks so that people can more successfully find and complete them.</p>

<p>Top task management isn’t new to the Government of Canada. In 2013, we compiled the first government-wide top task list to help design Canada.ca. And even earlier, several departments were experimenting with top task management for their own sites.</p>

<p>There are thousands of Government of Canada (GC) tasks out there, some small, and some complex. So how do we prioritize? By identifying the most important and most used tasks.</p>
 
                                                                                                                         
<h2 id="s2">Top task analysis</h2>
  
<p>Top task analysis attempts to answer the questions: who are your users and what are they trying to do?</p>  

<p>Most applicable to large corporate sites, such as a GC Departmental website.</p>  

<p>The methodology behind top task analysis consists of three steps:</p>  
  
<ol>
<li>identifying a longlist of tasks available on your website</li>
<li>an online survey to determine which of those tasks are most desired by users</li>
<li>analysis of the results</li>
</ol>

<p>These elements are examples of content that would <strong>not</strong>be considered within the scope of your institutions top tasks:</p> 
  
<ul>
<li>reading news about your institution</li>
<li>looking for or applying to jobs at your institution</li>
<li>accessing your institution's social media channels</li>
<li>looking for content by type, such as publications, frequently asked questions, forms or videos</li>
<li>finding, contacting or learning more about your institution (including viewing your institution's home page or mandate)</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, include tasks that <strong>are</strong> specific to your institution.</p> 

<p>Include <strong>at least one task</strong>  for each Canada.ca theme where you will have content. You can include more tasks if you have them, but try to limit to around 25 tasks per theme. You don't have to include a task for themes where you only have cross-links - only the primary home of your task.</p>

<h2 id="s3">User testing the Canada.ca product design</h2>
     
<p>Ongoing usability testing from 2014-2017, to evaluate the Canada.ca product design, undertaken by TBS as part of the <a href="http://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/wiki/Web_Renewal_Toolkit">GC Web Renewal Initiative.</a> ((accessible through Government of Canada networks only))</p>

<p>Results and findings from this project were used to drive continuous, iterative improvements for Canada.ca. Recommendations were incorporated into the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html">Canada.ca Content & Information Architecture Specification</a> and other product documentation.</p> 

<p>With this project, we are evaluating key aspects of Canada.ca's user interface design. Specifically:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Information architecture and navigation: Assess ease of use for site navigation and on-site search</li>
<li>Interaction design and page templates: Verify if page layouts are logically organized and easy to follow</li>
<li>Content design: Identify readability barriers</li>
</ul>

<p>This analysis informs the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification.html">Canada.ca Content & Information Architecture Specification</a> and the <a href="http://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html">WET component design</a>. </p> 

<h3>Strategic approach</h3>

<p>This project feeds into the strategic approach to usability testing for the GC Web Renewal initiative.</p> 

<p>Usability testing activities support improving both specific tasks on Canada.ca, as well as improving the overall design system for the site. In terms of design innovation, testing validates and generates IA models, page templates and design patterns. In terms of task optimization, testing drives continuous improvement to the content of the production Canada.ca website.</p> 

<p>Testing activities are undertaken across four streams:</p> 

  <div class="table-bravo">
       <table class="table table-bordered">
<thead><tr class="bg-primary"><th scope="col">Stream</th>
<th scope="col">Outcomes</th>

<h2 id="s4">Government-wide tree testing for Canada.ca themes</h2>
<h3>Overview and objectives</h3>

<p>This was a follow-up activity to the Tree testing for Canada.ca Themes project. It also builds on the findings uncovered during the first round of user testing Canada.ca.</p>    

<p>Whereas the theme-specific tree tests were aimed at ensuring that the topic tree for each theme was internally logical and coherent, the GC-wide activity is aimed at validating topics across all 15 themes on Canada.ca, as well as exploring the impact of integrating the Government section of the site.</p>    

<p>Four tree tests were conducted.</p>

<p>Need to explain how we got the results and what was done but not the results themselves.</p>       

<p>Need to explain how we do tree testing and how people submit topics tasks answers and proposed audience segments.</p>
