<h2 id="s1>Optimization</h2>

<p>Website optimization is the process of testing content with users then improving it based on the results. This is done to make websites as effective and user-friendly as possible. We help specific departments improve content for selected top tasks.</p>
 
<p>Departments will:</p>
<ul>
        <li>learn how to optimize content</li>
        <li>help their audiences find, use and understand content that supports their task</li>
</ul>
<p>Our experience will help us:</p>
<ul>
        <li>test our guidance and optimization techniques</li>
        <li>teach techniques that we know work well</li>
</ul>

Read more about our optimization process on our <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/category/2017/12/12/optimization-overview.html"> blog</a>. 
                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                    <h2 <h2 id="s2>Content Guidance for institutions</h2>
  
<p>Institutions must adopt new compliance requirements and recommendations for publishing Government of Canada content online. If youâ€™re preparing and writing web content, there are 2 documents you should be referring to begin with.</p>  
<p>The first is the Canada.ca Content and Information Specification. This document covers Information architecture models, topic tree, templates and design patterns. The second is the Canada.ca Content Style Guide which covers writing principles, plain language, tone, style, images and video, links and web content makeovers.</p>

</ul> 
  
  
<h2 id="s3>Canada.ca Content and Information Architecture Specification</h2>
     
<p>This design manual provides user-tested templates, navigation and information architecture models. Institutions use them to present and organize Government of Canada web content.</p>
<p>When developing and updating web content, institutions must also use the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html">Canada.ca Content Style Guide.</a></p>  
<p>Institutions are required to use this design manual and the style guide for their online content. You can read about the requirement in the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=30682">Directive on the Management of Communications.</a></p>
<p>The elements of this design manual are regularly updated based on the results of ongoing usability testing cycles. They have been developed in collaboration with Government of Canada Theme lead departments. </p>

<h2 id="s4>Canada.ca Content Style Guide</h2>
<p>The Canada.ca Content Style Guide establishes the rules to write and edit the Government of Canada's web content.</p>

<h2 id="s5>Controlled vocabularies</h2>
 <p>Canada.ca navigation and metadata leverage a number of controlled vocabularies. These are all managed centrally, by Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada and the Principal Publisher to support content discovery, curation and web analytics.</p>
