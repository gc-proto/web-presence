The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) is part of the Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada’s Strategic Communications and Ministerial Affairs branch. At DTO, we are communications professionals with expertise in plain language writing, content and interaction design, and user research.

We work with departments to:

* ensure that the Canada.ca brand is recognized and trusted by Canadians

* make information and services that are in-demand and published on digital channels easier to find and understand based on insight from user research

* help communications teams develop their skills and processes as they make a sustainable shift to digital in their organization
