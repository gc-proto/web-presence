<h2 id="1">Canada.ca, the web presence</h2>

<p>Canada.ca is the user-centric, task-based web presence of the Government of Canada. It is designed to help Canadians find and complete the tasks that matter to them.</p>

<p>Canada.ca aims to create a unified web experience across all departments and agencies, through the use of common patterns, templates and styles. It goes beyond a specific website, domain name or publishing platform.</p>
                                                                                                                        
<h2 id="2">Open, collaborative concept design</h2>
  
<p>The elements of this manual have been developed in collaboration with Government of Canada <a href="https://gc-proto.github.io/web-presence/howwedesign/theme-management/theme-management.html">Theme lead departments</a>. Other departments and agencies have also provided input.</p>  

<p>MWe are actively engaging with the community in several ways:</p>  

<ul>
<li>a social media presence, through the use of #Canadadotca</li>
<li>a <a href="https://canada-ca.github.io/">blog</a> that presents our work</li>
<li>ongoing, regular meetings with the Theme lead departments</li>
<li>events and presentations for all departments and agencies</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3">Evidence-based iteration</h2>
     
<p>The elements of this manual have been designed and revised based on evidence of needs of people and their success on the site.</p>

<p>The structure of the main menu of Canada.ca was based on our understanding of what Canadians are looking for. This was done through an analysis of public web usage data that was collected from across government departments and agencies. This analysis was supplemented with tree tests and other forms of usability testing to arrive at a navigation model.</p> 

<p>The Canada.ca information architecture, templates and patterns have been iteratively adjusted since 2013. This reflects the outcomes of multiple rounds of usability testing done with thousands of Canadians. We have done testing in English and French, on mobile, tablet, and desktop environments. We have also tested using assistive technologies.</p> 

<p>As evidence from new testing becomes available and departments try new ideas, this design manual will continue to be updated to better help people complete their tasks.</p> 

p>The desisn system is a living and evolving toolbox. Its role is to help departments leverage existing design patterns and styles for their specific content. It provides a consistent framework for the Government of Canada web presence, while being flexible enough to allow innovative design solutions.</p> 

<h2 id="4">Canadians first</h2>
<p>Canada.ca is based on the needs of Canadians. Through it, we made sure that the most in-demand information and services are easy to find, understand and use.</p>    

<p>Content must be organized to present a government-wide perspective to users, wherever possible. Non-priority content cannot interfere with the ability of someone to find what they are looking for.</p>    

<p>Information from multiple departments on the same topic of public interest must be grouped together. When duplicated content is identified, it should be removed.</p>

<p>Canada.ca must provide current, relevant, accurate, unique and authentic information about the Government of Canada (GC)’s programs and services. This reduces confusion for people.</p>       

<p>Content for which the GC is clearly not the authoritative source must not be published on Canada.ca. Instead, Canada.ca can refer to this content by providing links to an external source.</p>

<p>To ensure content is always current, it must be actively managed throughout its life cycle. This is required by the <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?section=text&id=12742">Government of Canada Information Management policy requirements</a>.</p>    
  
<h2 id="5">Task-centred approach</h2>
<p>People visit Canada.ca to complete a task. A task is something a person has set out to do or a question they want answered. To accomplish a task, a person may need to read a web page or undertake a complex transaction online. These tasks should be simple, consistent and predictable. Canada.ca concepts and layouts help ensure that the most in-demand tasks are easy to find, begin, and complete.</p>

<p>Once tasks have been located, people may be able to start and complete tasks in a straightforward manner. To this end, content needs to be designed and presented in a consistent and predictable way across Canada.ca.</p>

<p>The Canada.ca design improves task completion by providing people with consistent navigation, content labels, templates and design patterns. It also supports those who enter Canada.ca pages directly through Internet search engines or other ways like social media or direct traffic.</p>

<h2 id="6">Optimized for mobile devices</h2>

<p>More and more, Canadians are using mobile devices, including tablets and smart phones.</p>

<p>The Canada.ca design helps people to easily find the same content on either their mobile or desktop environment. The design system, including <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ws-nw/wa-aw/wet-boew/index-eng.asp">Web Experience Toolkit (WET)</a> templates and design components, uses a responsive design that has been tested and verified to work in mobile.</p>

<p>A separate mobile instance of the site is not needed.</p>

<p>To perform well on mobile devices, the information architecture (IA) is as simple and as flat as possible. In-page navigation is more effective than menus and page sizes must be limited. The content specifications and writing guidance take this mobile context into account. They also specify how to create content that will be downloaded easily on mobile devices. This allows people to access information quickly while on the go. For more details, see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-information-architecture-specification/performance-requirements.html">Performance requirements for Canada.ca.</a></p>

<h2 id="7">Integrated with search</h2>

<p>The Canada.ca information architecture must be well integrated with the site’s search function. An integrated approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides people with the necessary navigation cues, when search doesn’t take them to the right place</li>
<li>•	ensures filters are based on the underlying IA, such as the topic structure, to improve overall search precision and relevance</li>
</ul>
