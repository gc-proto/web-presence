  <h1 class="page-heading">Design system exemptions</h1>

<div>

    <p>Requests for exemptions to elements of Canada.ca design system must go through a review process. Departments have a review board that considers the request for exemption and determines if there are legitimate reasons to proceed. This departmental board can then recommend the exemption to the Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) at Treasury Board Secretariat.</p> 
  
 <p>The EARB makes the final decision as to whether there is a legitimate case for an exemption to specific elements of the design system.</p>

<h2 id="s1">Before seeking an exemption  </h2>

<p>Canada.caâ€™s style guide and specification help make it easier for Canadians to find and understand web content. The concepts were co-created with Theme Lead departments and tested extensively with Canadians. </p>

<p>Before seeking an exemption, departments should consider how the templates and standards add value to their web presence:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>consistent branding</strong> helps users understand that they have found authoritative Government of Canada content </li>
        <li><strong>accessibility and usability</strong> are built into the Canada.ca templates which means less effort for IT teams to ensure full WCAG compliance</li>
        <li><strong>navigation and usefulness</strong> improve, according to testing that shows Canadians find what they need to complete their task 80% of the time with the Canada.ca templates</li>
        <li><strong>mobile optimization</strong> is easy as the WET4 templates keep file sizes small; users can access content quickly on their phones or tablets without using up their data allowances</li>
        <li><strong>content development</strong> for the web is more effective when departments write using the Canada.ca Content Style Guide; meaning users can find and understand what departments want to share</li>
</ul>
