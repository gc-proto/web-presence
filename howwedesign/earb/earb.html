<h2 id="s1">Before seeking an exemption  </h2>

<p>Canada.caâ€™s style guide and specification help make it easier for Canadians to find and understand your web content. The concepts were co-created with Theme Lead departments and tested extensively with Canadians. </p>

<p>Before seeking an exemption, consider how the templates and standards add value to your web presence:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>consistent branding</strong> helps users understand that they have found authoritative Government of Canada content </li>
        <li><strong>accessibility and usability</strong> are built into the Canada.ca templates which means less effort for your IT teams to ensure full WCAG compliance</li>
        <li><strong>navigation and usefulness</strong> improve, according to testing that shows Canadians find what they need to complete their task 80% of the time with the Canada.ca templates</li>
        <li><strong>mobile optimization</strong> is easy as the WET4 templates keep file sizes small; users can access content quickly on their phones or tablets without using up their data allowances</li>
        <li><strong>content development</strong> for the web is more effective when you write using the Canada.ca Content Style Guide; meaning users can find and understand what you want to share</li>
</ul>
